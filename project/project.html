            WhatToDo? Gives students a new way to easily learn about  universities. While most resources focus on the educational aspects of an institution, WhatToDo? answers the question most students have once they arrive on a new campus, "What is there to do around here?". Now all you have to do is select a university from our extensive list and our system will find fun places to visit and exciting events to attend! This makes it easier than ever to explore and have adventures with friends that take you off campus and into the amazing experiences that are out there!
